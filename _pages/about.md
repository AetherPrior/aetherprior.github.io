I am a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in Natural Language Processing. I am currently working in Prof. [Maarten Sap](https://maartensap.com/)'s Lab on Harmlessness and Factuality in Language Models.
I am particularly interested in studying biases and toxicity in Language models and hope to extend it to multiple languages and modalities (**RAI**).

Prior to joining Carnegie Mellon, I spent a year as a predoctoral research fellow at [Microsoft Turing](https://turing.microsoft.com), where I worked on responsible AI for Large Language Models. I was part of Dr. [Monojit Choudhury](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/monojitc/)'s group, where we worked on exciting problems such as evaluating the ethical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models and Jailbreaking LLMs. As part of my product work at Turing India, I was involved in building [Bing Chat](https://chat.bing.com), where I developed multilingual classifiers for detecting harmful content!  

Before this, I had interned at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) with Dr. [Sunayana Sitaram](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/susitara/), on project [LITMUS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-litmus/), where I worked with the Bing Defensive team at Microsoft's Search Technology Center of India (STCI), to develop a multilingual query expansion pipeline.

As part of my undergraduate thesis at [SpeechLab, NTU](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/aseschng/speechLab_intro.html), I was advised by Prof. [Chng Eng-Siong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/aseschng) on Multilingual natural language processing. [\[Paper\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9980338) [\[Code\]](https://github.com/AetherPrior/Multilingual-Sentence-Boundary-detection/tree/main)

In my free time, I like to walk around campus and Pittsburgh. I also like learning about Languages and their origins; I am involved in a project with Monojit and [Quincy Amoah](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Quincy-Amoah) on the Sumerian Language!
