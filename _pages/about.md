I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley where I work in Programming Languages and Machine Learning.
I am particularly interested in how machine learning techniques can be used for developer productivity tools like program analysis, synthesis, and repair (**ML for PL**). 
I am also excited about how synthesis and verification can help in designing better generalizing and explainable algorithms and also reasoning about such algorithms (**PL for ML**)

I recieved my undergraduate degree from IIT Bombay where I was advised by Prof. [Sunita Sarawagi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita) on understanding robustness in natural language processing. Prior to that, I also delved quite a bit into computer vision (mostly adjacent to human-pose-estimation) with Prof. [Arjun Jain](https://arjunjain.co.in) and Prof. [Abhinav Shrivastava](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~abhinav/) at UMD College Park.

After my undergraduate, I spent two amazing years as a predoctoral research fellow at Microsoft Research India where I worked on machine learning and/or program synthesis. I was part of the [Project Jigsaw](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-jigsaw/) and worked on cool research problems like program-repair with static analysis tools, improving large language models with guarentees, and learning decision trees with bandit feedback.
