# aetherprior.github.io
- This is the repository for my personal website. Borrowed from [The Best Motherfucking Website](https://thebestmotherfucking.website/). 
- The website is hosted at [aetherprior.github.io](https://aetherprior.github.io/). A mirror is available at [abhinavrao.netlify.app](https://abhinavrao.netlify.app/).  
- The website runs on pure HTML, CSS, JS. The website has DejaVu Sans Mono fonts. Nothing else. The jquery file is a joke.  
- The website is Licensed under the [WTFPL license](LICENSE).

# Extremely basic
- The website is extremely basic. It has a home page, a cv page, and not yet a blog page.
- The website is designed to be extremely fast and lightweight. It is designed to be a simple static website that loads quickly and is easy to navigate.
- The website does everything almost natively, with the exception of icons, and the direct PDF export (shall I just yeet it?). 

# Export cv
The website supports exporting a cv to
- latex
- markdown
- direct pdf
- word
- print (like the ctrl-p kind)

The pdf cv comes directly from the export to LaTeX option. The other options are available in the cv page.
