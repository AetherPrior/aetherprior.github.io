# aetherprior.github.io
- This is the repository for my personal website. Borrowed from [The Best Motherfucking Website](https://thebestmotherfucking.website/). 
- The website is hosted at [aetherprior.github.io](https://aetherprior.github.io/). A mirror is available at [abhinavrao.netlify.app](https://abhinavrao.netlify.app/).  
- The website runs on pure HTML, CSS, JS. The website has DejaVu Sans Mono fonts. Nothing else. The jquery file is a joke.  
- The website is Licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt).

# Extremely basic
- The website is extremely basic. It has a home page, a cv page, and not yet a blog page.
- The website is designed to be extremely fast and lightweight. It is designed to be a simple static website that loads quickly and is easy to navigate.
- The website does everything almost natively, with the exception of icons for the CV. 
- The website supports exporting a cv to latex

# Setup 
You can clone the repository and run the website locally (arch linux only):  
`$ setup.sh`  
For other systems, you need to install TexLive, nvm, node and npm. And JSDom, Canvas as node packages.

# Export CV to LaTeX
Run the following command to export the cv to latex and push a commit:  
`$ push.sh`  
The pdf cv comes directly from the export to LaTeX option. The other options are available in the cv page.
